# VentControll
This code I wrote to control my ventilating system, which I am innovating for my bathroom and closet. I used an ESP32 controller to manage a couple of parameters via Wi-Fi, such as turning the venting system on and off, enabling silent mode, and controlling the LED lights.
VentControll_WireScheme is a visual explanation of the connections in this project.
