# VentControll

This code I wrote controls my ventilating system, which I am innovating for my bathroom and closet. I used an ESP32 controller to manage several parameters via Wi-Fi, such as turning the venting system on and off, enabling silent mode, and controlling the LED lights. 
VentControll_WireScheme is a visual explanation of the connections in this project.
