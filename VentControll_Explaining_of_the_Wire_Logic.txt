VentControll_Explaining_of_the_Wire_Logic:


The project "Ventilation Control" manages 12 fans and LED strips with yellow/white lights.
The fans have two modes: Silent mode and Full Power mode.

The ESP32 board enables control via Wi-Fi for:

Turning on/off 6 fans in the closet.
Turning on/off 6 fans in the bathroom.
Switching between Full Power and Silent mode for ventilation.
Turning on/off the LED lights.
Each set of 6 fans has an additional toggle switch to change the LED strip from yellow to white light and another switch to turn on/off an additional LED strip.

System Overview:

The system operates on a power supply of 220V, which is converted to 12V.

The 12V positive wire is separated into 4 paths:

Supplying 6 + 6 fans and LEDs.
Supplying the first buck converter, which reduces the voltage to 5V for the ESP32 power supply.
Supplying the second buck converter, which reduces the voltage to ~7V for "Silent mode".
Supplying the LED strips.

The ESP32 is connected to 4 relays with the following pins:

Pin 26 (Orange wire): Controls the 1st relay for switching the bus from 12V to 7V for "Silent mode".
Pin 27 (Violet wire): Controls the 2nd relay for turning on/off all LEDs.
Pin 33  (Green wire): Controls the relay for turning on/off the 6 bathroom fans.
Pin 34 (Yellow wire): Controls the relay for turning on/off the 6 closet fans.

sThe 12V negative wiring is also separated into 4 paths:

Supplying the first buck converter.
Supplying the second buck converter.
Supplying the 4th relay.
Supplying 2 parallel toggle switches that can change the negative wire of the LEDs to switch between yellow and white light.

Additionally, there are two more switches to cut the LED strip in half by cutting the positive wire supplying the LEDs.

The black negative and grey positive wires on the scheme represent the 5V bus from the ESP32, which supplies power to all four relays.
